# Codesans
Codesans is a family of sans serif fonts drawed by me with pencils. I also used 1mm-diameter gelpens to draw over marks drawed by pencils, to create the bold fonts.

I used a Kodak Pixpro AZ901 to take photos of graphs as DNG files, then I cropped these photos by [Microsoft Photos](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfjbh4?), scanned them and generated fonts by High-Logic FontCreator Professional.

Codesans is designed as a monospaced modification of [Handmark](https://github.com/JosephAbrahamBenFriedman/Handmark).
